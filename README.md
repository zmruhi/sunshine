So I am trying to learn making my very first app with the help of google online course on Udacity. 
I am a beginner in programming. I've learnt the basics of C before and currently been using Java for four months.
I understand the fact that my knowledge is insufficient to complete these journey that's why I am trying to learn here. I'll make mistakes and may go through a hard time learning all the stuff..but hope someone will always be there to help me.
